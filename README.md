Implementation of SHA-256 algorithm on FPGA
Abstract
This project presents the design and implementation of a high-performance Cryptographic 
Processor utilizing the SHA-256 algorithm, developed on a Xilinx Artix 7 DDR4 Field 
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using Verilog within the Xilinx Vivado environment. 
FPGAs offer significant advantages in cryptographic applications due to their parallel 
processing capabilities, enabling optimized hardware acceleration over traditional sequential 
CPU-based solutions. Our implementation processes input data in 512-bit blocks, incorporating 
padding and parsing mechanisms as per the SHA-256 standard, achieving a throughput 
approximately 20 times greater than a dual-core Intel processor. This performance gain is 
attributed to the FPGA’s concurrent operation execution and efficient use of DDR4 memory 
bandwidth. The processor serves as an effective Data Authenticator and holds potential for 
applications in secure communications, digital signatures, and blockchain systems. The design 
process leveraged Vivado’s advanced synthesis and simulation tools, ensuring modularity and 
scalability for future enhancements. This project demonstrates the practical benefits of FPGA
based cryptography, offering a robust, hardware-tailored solution that significantly outperforms 
software implementations. The successful realization of this processor highlights its promise 
for real-world security applications and opens avenues for further algorithmic integrations.
